# Development
## Requirements
**Required:**
* Golang ~> 1.23
**Preferred:**
* Make
* Docker

## Getting Started
The following commands download all dependencies and installs any required tools for development.
```bash
go mod download
make build-tools
```

Anytime changes to the gRPC API are made, the following command should be run to generate protobuf files and update the mocks used for testing.
```bash
make protos
```

## Migrations
Any changes to the underlying database schema should be reflected with a migration file in the migrations folder. The following command will generate a new migration file.
```bash
migrate create -ext sql -dir migrations
```

Migrations are auto applied on startup when using a pgx repository.

## Building
The application version is automatically taken as the latest version tag.
**Binary:** `make build` the output result will be placed in the `bin` folder in the project root directory.\ 
**Docker:** \
* `make docker` builds a docker image called `sro-<app-name>` with 3 tags variants `latest`, `${version}`, and `${version}-${commit hash}`.
* `make push` push the image to the docker repository.
* `make docker push` runs docker then push.

Note: A helper command `make aws-docker-login` is available to authenticate with the default aws credential context if pushing to AWS ECR.

## Testing
* `make test` runs all tests and builds a coverage report
* `make report` views the coverage report in the browser
* `make test-watch` runs the tests with coverage on all `.go` file changes.
* `make report-watch` updates coverage results as they update.
* `make dev-watch -j` simply runs both `test-watch` and `report-watch` in parallel.
